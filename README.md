sdl-xbmc-remote
=======

sdl-xbmc-remote is a remote control software for XBMC media center which uses EventClient to communicate with XBMC and SDL to get user input. It's intended to be used mainly on OpenPandora, but it'll be kept portable, so that other platforms with SDL can support it too.


Currently, it can move mouse and ENTER, ESC and BACKSPACE keys should also work. The next step is to implement key mapping, so users can choose what their actions do...
